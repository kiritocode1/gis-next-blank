Change Summary:

-   Implemented custom HTML OverlayView markers with glow+pulse and hover legend to match dark theme, inspired by The Globe of Economic Complexity.
-   Replaced Google Maps Marker and InfoWindow usage for regular markers and KML-derived points with HTML overlays.
-   Injected one-time CSS for markers; added helper `createHtmlMarker`.
-   Cleaned unused imports/vars; preserved prop API (`onCCTVToggle`) for compatibility.

Files Updated:

-   src/components/GoogleMap.tsx
    -   Import cleanup: L5
    -   API comment/no-op param usage: L63-L66, L92-L94
    -   CSS injection for markers: L114-L133
    -   Helper `createHtmlMarker`: L135-L197
    -   Marker overlays effect (replaces Google Markers): L325-L383
    -   KML marker overlays (replace Marker+InfoWindow): L564-L584
    -   Removed unused `infoWindowRef` (no longer present)

Notes:

-   Marker color defaults to `#22d3ee`; group color can be set via `markerGroups[].color`.
-   Hover reveals a compact legend; click still calls `onPointClick`.
-   No changes to `legacy` dir or `node_modules`.
