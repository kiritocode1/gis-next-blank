**Changes Made**:

1. **Procession Routes Panel Implementation**:

    - Replaced Map Settings sidebar section with Procession Routes panel
    - Added festival-based route grouping with color-coded toggles
    - Implemented route rendering with glowing polylines and start/end markers
    - Added lazy loading - routes only fetch when festival toggles are enabled
    - Created hash-based color assignment for consistent festival colors
    - Added route click handlers for detailed information display
    - **Fixed sidebar section routing**: Moved procession routes from "Layers" section to dedicated "Procession Routes" section using new `processionRoutes` prop
    - **Added load button**: Added "Load Procession Routes" button to fetch and display festival routes when sidebar is empty
    - **Enhanced polyline rendering**: Fixed missing setMap() calls and added triple-layer glow effect (main line + inner glow + outer glow) with improved marker styling
    - **Refined marker styling**: Removed borders from start/end markers to match map layers style and removed click handlers to prevent pin overlay on map

2. **Added Procession-Related Endpoints**: Added missing endpoints to health check system:

    - `get-route-gap-analysis` - Analyzes route coverage and identifies gaps
    - `get-festivals` - Festival data and categories
    - Enhanced `get-procession-routes` schema with optional categorized data

3. **Fixed Police Stations Schema**: Changed police stations endpoint to use `get-map-data` and filter for police stations with category "पोलीस आस्थापना" instead of using the empty `get-police-stations` endpoint. Successfully found 180 police stations out of 8,132 total data points.

4. **Fixed Route Gap Analysis Schema**: Updated schema to match actual API response structure with `gap_analysis` and `summary` fields instead of `analysis` field, and made fields optional to handle error cases

5. **Added Police Stations to Main Map**: Integrated police stations from map data into main page with toggles and heatmap functionality, matching the pattern of other layers (CCTV, ATM, Bank, Hospital)

6. **Zod Schema Definition**: Created strict schemas for all external API endpoints including:

    - Map data with crime incidents, police stations, emergency services
    - Categories and subcategories for data classification
    - Healthcare facilities (hospitals, CCTV, ATMs, banks)
    - Law enforcement data (police stations, crime data)
    - Traffic management (AI monitoring, accident data)
    - System endpoints (health check, dashboard stats)

7. **Health Check Service**: Built comprehensive testing service that:

    - Tests all 15+ external API endpoints from rhtechnology.in
    - Validates responses against Zod schemas
    - Measures response times and handles timeouts
    - Analyzes schema differences (missing fields, extra fields, type mismatches)
    - Provides sample data (first 5 items) from each endpoint

8. **Health Check UI**: Created modern, responsive interface with:

    - **Overview Tab**: Quick status overview with success/failure counts
    - **Details Tab**: Detailed endpoint information with sample data
    - **Schema Analysis Tab**: Zod validation results and difference analysis
    - Real-time refresh functionality
    - Color-coded status indicators and response time monitoring

9. **Navigation Integration**: Added health check link in main page header for easy access

10. **Documentation**: Created comprehensive documentation covering:
    - Feature overview and usage instructions
    - Complete list of monitored endpoints
    - Schema validation details
    - Error handling and monitoring best practices
    - Technical implementation details

**Key Features Implemented**:

-   Real-time API endpoint monitoring
-   Zod schema validation with detailed error reporting
-   Sample data display (first 5 JSON items)
-   Schema difference analysis (missing/extra fields, type mismatches)
-   Response time monitoring with timeout handling
-   Three-view interface (Overview, Details, Schema Analysis)
-   Comprehensive error handling and reporting
-   Modern UI with Tailwind CSS and Radix UI components

**Technical Stack Used**:

-   Zod for runtime type validation
-   Next.js with TypeScript
-   Tailwind CSS for styling
-   Radix UI for accessible components
-   Lucide React for icons
-   Fetch API for HTTP requests

**Purpose**: The health check system provides comprehensive monitoring of all external API endpoints, ensuring data integrity and API reliability through schema validation and detailed analysis of response data.
